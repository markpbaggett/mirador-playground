      "The Cowboy's Flute is a traditional folk melody of China, which has the Mountain-River painting style giving you a sense of countryside. After getting her and her family's permission, I select a good edition from her classroom-performance into sound image. The player is a little girl named Guo Guo (Fruit and fruit) which was quite lovely."
